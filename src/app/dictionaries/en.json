    "ourHistoryp1": "In 1913, barber Don Jacobo Eddi arrived in the young city of Neuquén with his wife, Julia Zerahia, after a long journey from Roshpina, Palestine. At just fourteen years old, the beautiful Julia married the handsome Jacobo, who had just turned eighteen. They decided to settle in the capital of the territory, where Jacobo opened his first store, Baratillo Eddi, on Sarmiento Street 36, in November 1918. This location had previously been Rosenblat Jewelry, one of the city's first. Today, their legacy continues on the bustling Sarmiento Street under the name Tienda Eddi, although with a different owner.",
    "ourHistoryp2": "Jacobo and Julia raised a large family, having six children: Raquel, Fortunata, Esther, Felisa, Rafael, and Víctor. However, the crisis of the 1930s forced them to move to Buenos Aires. There, Víctor studied at Mariano Moreno School and later joined the military, where he formed a lasting friendship with Neuquén native Jorge Wilfredo Celoria.",
    "ourHistoryp3": "In 1948, Víctor married Elena, daughter of the Darmún family, who was on her way to becoming a teacher. Their eldest sons, Roberto and Ricardo, were born in Buenos Aires. They returned to Neuquén with them, where Víctor took over the family business, the renowned Casa Darmún. In this city, their youngest daughter, Julita, was born.",
    "ourHistoryp4": "Elena Lela Darmún worked as a teacher in several schools in Neuquén, including School No. 61, No. 2, No. 121, and No. 118, being one of the first permanent teachers. Meanwhile, Víctor led an active social and professional life, serving as president of the Independiente Club and a member of its board since 1960. He was also part of the Rotary Club, an advisory director of Banco Los Andes de Mendoza, a member of the Neuquén Hotel Association, ACIPAN, a lifetime member of the Biguá Club, and a co-founder of Canal 7 Neuquén.",
    "ourHistoryp5": "In 1964, Víctor left the family stores and acquired a property on Olascoaga Avenue 200, where he opened 'El Rey de los Pantalones.' He later inaugurated another store at Olascoaga 219, named 'Lencería Juli,' followed by 'Ella, Medias.' Meanwhile, the Hotel Crystal was built and inaugurated on January 14, 1966, with ten rooms. Years later, a plot of land was purchased from Remigio Bosch to continue expansions.",
    "ourHistoryp6": "Víctor's three children continued their lives in the city where their grandparents had arrived when the population was no more than two thousand: Roberto became an accountant, Ricardo an architect, and Julia a systems analyst.",
    "ourHistoryp7": "Currently, the hotel has 45 rooms and 99 beds. These rooms are categorized as single, double, triple, and quadruple. Additionally, there is an adequate number of superior rooms. The superior rooms differ from the standard ones by offering complimentary breakfast and some extra amenities, such as a refrigerator, an electric kettle, and a larger desk. Since July 1, 2018, Mr. Rodrigo Fernández has acquired the hotel's business name and manages it with his team, continuing the tradition of hospitality and service that has characterized Hotel Crystal over the years.",
    "ourHistoryp8": "Hotel Crystal is the culmination of this rich family history, a place that reflects a commitment to hospitality and exceptional service. Every guest is welcomed with the same warmth that characterized the Darmún/Eddi family, ensuring everyone feels at home. This story of love, effort, and unity is the essence of Hotel Crystal, where the past meets the present, and every visit contributes to the continuation of this beautiful family tradition."
